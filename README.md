# ArtisanAI-email-task

Task Description:

1. Data Analysis:

- Given a dataset on email engagement (including open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates), perform exploratory data analysis.
- Identify potential key patterns and insights, using statistical and visualization techniques.

2. Model Development:

- Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of email engagement (open rates or link clicks) based on the features available in the dataset.
- Document the model development process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and validation in a Jupyter notebook.

3. Insights and Reporting:

- Analyze the modelâ€™s performance and interpret its predictions
- Draft a report summarizing the analysis approach, model development process, key findings, and actionable insights for improving email engagement.

4. Collaboration Simulation:

- Submit the Jupyter Notebook and report as a pull request in a simulated version control environment. The pull request description should clearly articulate the changes and their rationale.

Deliverables:

* A Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis and model development code.
* A concise report summarizing methodology, findings, and recommendations.
